              <h2>Biography</h2>
              <p>
                Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is
                the creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which
                is the kernel for a number of operating systems. He also created
                the version control system Git. Torvalds was born on December
                28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He studied computer science at
                the University of Helsinki, and he developed the Linux kernel as
                a student project in 1991. Since then, the Linux kernel has
                become one of the most widely used kernels in the world,
                powering everything from smartphones to supercomputers.
